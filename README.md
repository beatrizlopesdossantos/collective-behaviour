- provide the starting point,
- write a rough sketch of what you plan to do during the course (plan with respect to the 3 report deadlines),
- use the report deadlines as milestones

## 1st report
Review of concepts and existing models

General overview of the problem and provide an idea of how you intend to approach to solve the problem

Follow the IMRAD (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion) architecture for scientific writing.

Prepare the report with the provided template.

The page limit is 4 pages, but quality should be paramount

## 2nd report
Polishing of the previous report based on the received comments

Details about the methods and the proposed methodology for verification

Individual contributions of the authors must be specified (i.e. "JN wrote the introduction and polished the english language, MK performed the data analysis and prepared the images, IC implemented algorithm A and ran the experiments").

## 3rd report
Based on a polished version (in view of the received comments) of previous reports.

The introduction must be concise, mention relevant existing research, and use supporting research to present the problem, as well as reasons why you deem your solution to be of impact.

The methods section must present details about your approach as well as the methodology employed for evaluation. Again it should be concise and provide enough details that one could reimplement your solution. 

The results section should include some form of comparison with previous research. In the discussion section discuss your results in view of previous research and provide some ideas for future work.
Attach also the slides of your presentation. It should not be longer than 20min
a) provide a general overview of the problem and why it should interest anyone
b) what was your starting goal and what were you able to achieve
c) what were the biggest challenges and how did you solve them
d) what would you do differently, should you start all over again?
